A nice solution to add Tasm / Masm Assemblers to Windows environment paths for users who runs these inside specific folder mounted DOSBoxes..

This enables user to invoke tasm / masm and run in dosbox from anywhere in Windows, (even folders with long file names, which are normally not supported in DOSBox)

### Installation:

1. Copy the ASM Folder to C:\
2. Add C:\ASM to Windows Path

Now, the scripts inside ASM folder such as tasm.bat, masm.bat, tlink.bat...etc should be accessible from anywhere via commandline
